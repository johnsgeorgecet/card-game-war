logic:
shuffle the deck and divide it into two between player 1 and player 2
main loop until either of the player has empty hand - that is the list is empty
each player draws a card and compare between them, higher value player will win both cards, goes to his hands' bottom
if equal, toggle on a at war boolean, goes into at war loop
continue drawing, if either player wins, add all cards to that player
